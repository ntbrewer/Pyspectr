Description: ===========
        Pyspectr
        ===========
        
        Pyspectr provides nuclear spectroscopy tools, specifically targeted
        to use with the his/drr histogram files used by the upak library. Apart from
        reading the binary input files, it provides some tools like half-life fitting,
        peak-fitting and pydamm program, mimicking the DAMM program from the upak.
        Users are encouraged to use pydamm within ipython3 shell, as it offers a great
        advantages over standard python3 shell, such as tab-completion with history
        search, input/outputs registry (as in Maxima or Mathematica), etc.  However, it
        is also possible to work with pydamm within the standard python3 shell.
        
        
        Instalation
        ===========
        This package requires the following modules:
        * numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
        * matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/, 
                      https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
        * lmfit (https://github.com/newville/lmfit-py,
                 http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/python/lmfit/)
        
        It is also recommended to install the ipython shell:
        * ipython (http://ipython.org/) (make sure it links to python3 or use ipython3)
        However, the standard python shell will also work.
        
        In a typical Linux distribution the numpy, matplotlib and ipython should be
        included in the package manager repositories (note that python3 version is
        needed). If they are missing the github repositories include information about
        the building and installation procedure (it is very simple). The lmfit library
        on the github includes the standard pythons distutils setup script and is also
        very easy to install.
        
        !!!
        Now on Pypi.org
        !!!
        All you need now is:
        $ pip3 install Pyspectr
        and you should be good to go. 
        
        or via:
        Once the required libraries are in place, install the Pyspectr with:
            python3 setup.py build
            sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        pydamm
        ------
        Important note for use with ipython3! 
        in order to have the correct interactivity functionality begin the ipython session with 
        the magic command %matplotlib.
         
        In [1]: %matplotlib
        
        and/or use the startup script 00-pyspectr.py in the directory
        ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/ (Linux) 
        or similar for other distros. This magic puts matplotlib interactivity in the correct shell loop. 
        See ipython documentation for further detail. 
        
        Pydamm is a DAMM-like python module, so a typical session starts with importing
        the pydamm module:
        >>> from Pyspectr.pydamm import *
        
        
        The main class for the data analysis is the Experiment, it requires a file
        name (.his) to be given in the constructor:
        >>> e = Experiment('data_file.his')
        or tar gzipped file (.tgz, .tar.gz):
        >>> e = Experiment('data_file.tgz')
        
        Once the Experiment object is created follow DAMM-like syntax to display
        and analyze the data:
        >>> e.d(100)
        >>> e.dl(0, 1000)
        >>> e.gx(1000, (212, 214))
        ...
        
        However, there are some useful things that the DAMM couldn't do easily. Check
        functions like Experiment.show_registry(), Experiment.gamma_gamma_spectra(),
        Experiment.fit_decay(), ...
        
        Finally remember about the python's build-in help(), that should allow you to
        investigate the available variables and methods. While the documentation is
        far from being perfect, at least it should give you a hint about possibilities.
        
        spectrum_fitter
        ---------------
        
        This script fits the peaks in a .his or .txt spectrum file. The peak function
        include the Gaussian function, skewed Gaussian and more. The fit
        configuration is done via XML config file, see spectrum_fitter_example.xml
        
        
        py_grow_decay
        -------------
        
        This script fits the grow-in/decay pattern, typical in the experiments with the
        Moving Tape Collector. Available models include 1st and 2nd isotope in the
        chain, isomeric decay, diffusion corrected decay and more. See
        grow_decay_example.xml for XML config file structure.
        
        
        00-pyspectr.py
        --------------
        
        This script is placed in the startup directory for proper functionality of Pyspectr/matplotlib interactivity.
